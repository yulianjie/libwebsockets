 *
 * Secure Streams is a *payload-only* client communication channel where all the
 * details about the connection are held in a systemwide policy database and
 * are keyed by the streamtype field... the user of the communication channel
 * does not know or manage the choice of endpoint, tls CA, or even wire
 * protocol.  The advantage is he then does not have any dependency on any of
 * those and they can be changed just by changing the policy database without
 * touching the code using the stream.
 *
 * There are two ways secure streams interfaces to user code:
 *
 * 1) [Linux / RTOS] the natural, smallest interface is to call back to user
 *    code that only operates directly from the lws event loop thread context
 *    (direct callbacks from lws_ss_t)
 *
 *    lws_thread( [user code] ---- lws )
 *
 * 2) [Linux] where the user code is in a different process and communicates
 *    asynchronously via a proxy socket
 *
 *    user_process{ [user code] | shim | socket-}------ lws_process{ lws }
 *
 * In the second, IPC, case, all packets are prepended by one or more bytes
 * indicating the packet type and serializing any associated data, known as
 * Serialized Secure Streams or SSS.
